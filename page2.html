            <h2> Fact 1 </h2>
            <p>While the Athenian Acropolis is often what comes to mind when people hear the word acropolis, it is one of many acropoleis built across Greece. Based on the ancient Greek words ákros for high point and pólis for city, acropolis means roughly “high city,” and can refer to any similarly situated citadel.</p>

        <h2> Fact 2 </h2>
       <p>Humans have inhabited the limestone slopes of what became the Acropolis for centuries; they were likely drawn to the water from its natural springs. There's evidence of habitation in the area dating back to the Neolithic period between 4000-3200 BCE, with both a house and a grave identified from around this era. A series of shafts have also been discovered, with several vessels found in their deep chasms.</p>

        <h2> Fact 3 </h2>
        <p>
            Also known as Navagio Beach or Smuggler’s Cove, Zakynthos Shipwreck Beach is home to the rusty remains of MV Panayiotis; a vessel shrouded in mystery. The incredible wreck is half-buried in the pearly white sand just meters from the shore. It draws adventurers in their droves to marvel at its magnificent bulkhead and is thought to be the most photographed shipwreck in the world.
